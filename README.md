#UniveristyManagementSystem

This is my final project for CS50 SQL.
For this project, I’ve built a University Management System, a database that helps manage students, faculty, courses, enrollments, and grades.
The purpose of this project is to streamline academic record-keeping and provide an efficient way for universities to track course offerings, student progress, and faculty assignments.
